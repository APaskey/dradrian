Let’s take a look at how long-term effects are defined for vaccines that have been around for a while, as well as what data we have from the COVID vaccines with regard to long-term effects. “Long-term” could be used to describe any side effect that appears more than several days following vaccination (though the effect/symptoms could last longer than that). Most side effects occur within days after receiving the vaccine, resolve within days, and are obvious: fever, sore arm, headache, rash, for example. 

# “Long-term effects” in pre-COVID vaccines

The FDA has defined the evaluation window for symptoms following vaccination based on the timing of when long-term effects from previous vaccines have occurred. One example of a vaccine that can cause rare long-term side effects is the **yellow fever vaccine.** Infants who receive this vaccine may develop brain or spinal cord swelling ~2-3 weeks following vaccination. However, infants are not recommended to receive the yellow fever vaccine. Another example of a vaccine with possible (low-risk) “long-term” side effects is the **MMR vaccine;** there is a risk for thrombocytopenia (temporary decrease in platelets) ~1-3 weeks after receiving the vaccine (in 1/30,000 people). The CDC has a list of all known side effects for vaccines on [this webpage.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) Serious side effects from vaccines are rare and the benefit of vaccination must outweigh the risk of the side effect in order for it to be recommended for use in the US.

# How are concerns about long-term side effects from the COVID vaccines being handled in the US?

Though rare, six cases of blood clots have occurred in women who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the US (for context, ~7 million doses of this vaccine have been given already in the US). The clots appeared within two weeks following vaccination. These blood clots are the reason that distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be paused until FDA can review data and evaluate risk. Notably, this possible clotting risk is not associated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. So, what data are being collected to evaluate long-term risk?

- The FDA can further examine data from trials conducted prior to Emergency Use Authorization, where symptoms of trial participants were followed for months following vaccination
- Adverse events are reported by health care providers to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (In the case of unusual adverse events, CDC/FDA have access to case information. For example, they will review the cases of the women who experienced blood clots following vaccination to assess potential significance - [slides here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/index.html))
- The CDC’s V-safe self-reporting app has been used to collect self-reported symptom information from the general public following vaccination

# Has vaccination ever been paused, like the Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine is being paused right now?

Yes; one example is the rotavirus vaccine (given to children). This vaccine was recommended to be paused in 2010 so  FDA could evaluate concerns that arose during use, despite there being no evidence at the time of any health risk to children. FDA gathered data, got input from external experts, and had a public hearing of issues (sound familiar?). Vaccination was resumed once it was concluded that the vaccine was safe for kids.

Most of all, I want to tell you that the most notable long-term effect of the vaccine is **immunity!!** These vaccines are approved for use because they work, and the benefits of protection far outweigh the risk of side effects. I hope this helps address your concerns about how long-term vaccine side effects are evaluated. Please reach out with questions!


[Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has a great article](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine) that helped me write this post

[CHOP also has a video explainer about it](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/video/what-are-the-long-term-side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccine)

[This article](https://edwardnirenberg.medium.com/long-term-effects-of-covid-19-vaccines-should-you-be-worried-c3c3a547b565) was written last summer and I think it touches on important concepts and is a good read.
