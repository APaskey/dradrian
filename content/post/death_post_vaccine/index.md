I’ve been asked several variations of this question, and I haven’t always known the primary source that led the asker to their question specifically. If there’s a particular resource/news article that is causing you concern, and you feel comfortable sharing it, please feel free to send it my way so we can look at it together. I am happy to do so. In this post I will break down what I’ve read based on the CDC’s [COVID-19 vaccine safety update](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-01/06-COVID-Shimabukuro.pdf) for two groups: elderly and those under 65.

- Elderly

I’d like you to scroll a bit more than halfway down the powerpoint to the title slide “Reports of of deaths and mortality following COVID-19 vaccination.” You can see in these data that over half of those who died following vaccination (66%) *for any reason* (car accident, old age, disease, etc.) were long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. They first broke down the background rate of expected deaths in that group, since the average age of those who died following vaccination was 79, and many of them were LTCF residents. They did this to compare the number of people who died following vaccination to the number of people who normally pass away over the same time period in the same group. If the numbers in the vaccinated group are higher, then that’s a big problem; if the numbers in the vaccinated group are the same or lower, then those numbers are not concerning. They found that, based on background rate calculations, they could expect 11,440 deaths among LTCF residents based on the time period they measured (29 days) and the proportion of all residents that were vaccinated during that period. 

Since only 129 deaths were reported during that same period, and one could reasonably expect coincidental events to account for that number within the background rate, that the vaccine was not the cause of these deaths. If you keep scrolling down, you can see the cause of death for some of these individuals. It appears as though these individuals had other health issues and were in declining health in general, as is not unusual when a person is living in a long-term care facility. In general, mortality has been lower in vaccinated LTCF residents as compared to unvaccinated residents.

- Under 65

This report also looks into deaths of those younger than 65 following vaccination. Similar approach to this analysis: look at the background rates and see if they’re different from the deaths in people under 65 who received the vaccine. There were 28 deaths in those under 65 in the US. Since 18 of those deaths were sudden cardiac deaths, this number (18) was compared to the expected number of sudden cardiac deaths in the community. The expected number of sudden cardiac deaths in the US across the same time periods 168, which is much greater than the observed 18. Other known, non-heart-related causes of deaths from those under 65 include drug overdose, cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhage (this can result from head injury or ruptured cerebral aneurysm), or COVID (which they could have been infected with prior to vaccination).

Overall, the US government has implemented the most comprehensive vaccine safety monitoring program in history. They will continue to monitor the community and report their findings. As always, feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss these data or other resources you may have come across.
