In prior posts I’ve repeatedly cautioned anyone who is vaccinated to maintain physical distance and use protective measures to prevent becoming infected in the absence of data to assure us that the existing COVID vaccines both lower the risk of disease and infection. The distinction I’ve been discussing is between protection from the *disease,* COVID, and protection from *asymptomatic infection* where someone can pass the virus on to another without realizing it. We finally have enough comprehensive data on *infection* post-vaccination to help you make informed decisions! I’ll first break down what infection data has been reported to my knowledge, then discuss how this lends to the current CDC reccomendations.

First, let me point out that these data were each acquired by different studies/measures and not from the same study.

- Johnson & Johnson vaccine was found to have an efficacy of 74.2% against infection 29 days after one dose
- Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to have 75% effectiveness against infection ~2 weeks after the first dose by studies in the UK and Israel
- Moderna vaccine was found to have 89% efficacy against infection 2 weeks after the first dose ([data here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389/suppl_file/nejmoa2035389_appendix.pdf))
- Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has 67% efficacy against any infection 2 weeks after first dose 

It looks like the probability of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination is low, indeed (but not zero!). With these data in-hand, it might not be a surprise that the CDC released recommendations this week that give vaccinated people guidance on what situations are of “low enough” risk. Here’s a take-home from the interim guidance:

1. A fully vaccinated household can interact with another vaccinated or low-risk, unvaccinated household without any prevention methods required.
2. Prevention methods (masks, physical distance, good ventilation) are required when fully vaccinated people interact with others in the following scenarios: 
	- with high-risk, unvaccinated households 
	- with households who interact with high-risk people (at work, for example)
	- if interacting with **multiple** unvaccinated households (regardless of risk category).

Basically, the guidance is trying to accommodate the fact that the risk of being infectious after being vaccinated is *low* but **not** zero. Be smart, and give (vaccinated) grandma a hug for me if you get to see her.
