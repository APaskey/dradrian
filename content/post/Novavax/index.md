Novavax is starting their phase 3 clinical trial in the US and Mexico! [Do you qualify to participate?](https://www.novavax.com/PREVENT-19) I’m a fan of any vaccine that will get us closer to herd immunity, but I’m especially a fan of this one. I think it’s a really smart way to build immunity. Here’s a brief summary of what this vaccine is: lots of spike proteins are produced in the laboratory and then assembled into “nanoparticles.” Nanoparticles are little virus-sized compounds of spike protein, that are then injected as part of the vaccine (along with an adjuvant, a thing that metaphorically waves a flag at your immune system and says “hey, look over here!”). The immune response to this approach looks really promising, as measured by antibody levels gained by participants in clinical trials. You can’t get COVID from a Novavax vaccine because the injection only contains a small part of the protein from the virus. As phase 3 trials haven’t been completed yet, it will take a while before data can be presented to the FDA for approval consideration.
