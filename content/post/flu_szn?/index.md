Alright, nobody asked me this but it's something I think is interesting. Because we've had different routines over the course of the pandemic, the usual things that make us sick circulate at higher-than-usual levels every time we drop precautions. This is because the things we do like masking up, sticking to well-ventilated areas (i.e., socializing outdoors, or keeping windows open), and in general avoiding large gatherings of people outside our usual circles keep us safe from more than just COVID. I came across this article on a site I follow (Kinsa, a company that aggregates data on illness, particularly in kiddos). I think it's worth sharing. If you're curious about flu's offseason comeback, check [this article](https://healthweather.us/analysis/is-the-flu-making-a-late-season-comeback?utm_campaign=Health%20Alerts&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=210361718&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Z6G47N93e8a0hQM2Kd86UCeWzW_cyFsjJ9ZnJFTPp0soAjPrJu6M-evhwb2U6s3dVNjnfSWNqIc9HTQVFexAVz_gg-w&utm_content=210362202&utm_source=hs_email) out! What does this mean for you? If you're COVID-negative this spring but have flu-like symptoms, your doc may have you checked for flu even though it's not typical "flu season." If you've been enjoying a cold/flu-free lifestyle, then consider working some preventative measures such as opting for well-ventilated settings for gatherings, handwashing, masking into your longer-term habits.


A different topic, but also touches on flu and other infections...I recently saw this blog (written by the CEO of Kinsa) that might interest you: [How kindness can play a role in public health](https://inder-singh.medium.com/killing-it-with-kindness-how-respect-can-change-the-covid-game-d63342137c1d).
