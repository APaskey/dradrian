I hate to say this, but there's truly no "safe" way to visit right now. I can give you a few things to think about to help you navigate this decision. I think it's really smart of you to be thinking through the risks to decide what makes sense for your family:

- A vaccinated person should have immunity ~2 weeks after the second dose
- The vaccine isn't 100% effective, so there will definitely be a risk anytime people are interacting in an area with community transmission and before herd immunity is reached (when somewhere over 70% of people in your community = fully vaccinated)
- Are there options for well-ventilated areas that you could interact specifically with your loved one? Maybe a screened-in porch or patio with a space heater? This would minimize your chances of unintentionally infecting your loved one, caregiving staff, or other residents in the community/congregate care setting, since SARS-CoV-2 can asymptomatically spread.
- Even though it's completely reasonable to expect that your fully vaccinated loved one will not get sick from COVID because they’ve been vaccinated, there is a possibility that they could become infected with the virus and still spread it to you or other residents.

I hope this info helps and please let me know if I can provide more information
