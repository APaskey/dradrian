In the coming months, there will be more COVID vaccines approved in the United States. While few of us will have a choice with regard to the actual vaccine available to us in 2021, you may be wondering if one is more ideal than another. In my opinion, you donâ€™t need to worry unless you have a specific allergy.

The case where it *really* matters which COVID vaccine someone gets would be if a person has an allergy to an ingredient in one vaccine and not another. Typically those people know who they are, and their primary care physician can help them figure out what to do.

For the rest of us, the good news is that all approved vaccines perform to a high standard. Letâ€™s take a look at a comparison of already-approved vaccines alongside soon-to-be approved ones. First of all, thanks to Dr. Sasha Larsen for pointing out this resource and to Dr. @eraimondeau for creating amazing content to share! By the way, [his website is phenomenal and you should check it out.](http://lapipette.com/category/infographics.html) You can see notation on each card indicating:

- general price point
- type of vaccine it is (mRNA or viral vector)/how it works
- reported efficacy against the most prevalent US/UK variants
- reported efficacy (if available) against variants of concern
- how many doses are required
- what temperature the vaccine is stored at and for how long

The first obvious thing Iâ€™d like to point out is that efficacy is greater than 50% for each of these vaccines. Thatâ€™s the minimum for FDA approval, and you can see that each surpasses that standard (note that only the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are approved so far). As Iâ€™ve discussed in previous posts, there are elements that make each option shine like storage time/temperature, number of doses, % efficacy, but each will do what we need them to do: lower the risk of severe COVID to keep most folks out of the hospital and inch our populations closer to herd immunity! When itâ€™s your turn to get vaccinated, Iâ€™d recommend doing so!

Here are infographics for the Novavax, Sputnik V, Sinopharm, and SinoVac vaccines.

I havenâ€™t written about Sinopharm and SinoVac on here, but the inactivated virus approach is a very traditional one. Example of other inactivated virus vaccines include the flu and polio shots.
