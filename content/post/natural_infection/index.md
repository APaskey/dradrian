**Am I immune if I had COVID already?**

It’s possible that you may have had COVID before testing was widely available in the US. Multiple variables like how much virus you were exposed to affect whether you could still have immunity after being naturally infected (as opposed to vaccinated) in March 2020, for example. One reason the vaccine is able to provide longer lasting immunity than natural infection is because it directs the immune response in a controlled/predictable way to provide protection from disease (mRNA vaccines do this with two doses by [priming and boosting](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/adaptive_immunity/)). 

**How can I find out if I had COVID already?**

If a person were to take an [antibody test,](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/testing/) they would be able to tell if they were infected previously with fairly high confidence if the test were positive. The caveat to this is that a positive test could be a *false positive,* meaning that the test detected cross-reactive antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2 but actually developed in response to a different virus exposure or randomness.

**Should I get vaccinated if I had COVID already?**

Having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection does not mean that a person will be protected from future infection long-term. There have been reports of reinfection. Based on what I know, it’s reasonable to expect that someone who was infected and has antibodies would have a decent level of immunity but not an excellent or a long-term one. My opinion: take the vaccine so your immunity will last longer!

An important note from the CDC website on post-COVID vaccination: "Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection. If you were treated for COVID-19 symptoms with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine."
