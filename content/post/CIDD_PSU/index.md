I just came across PSU CIDD's [FAQ page for COVID-related concerns](https://www.huck.psu.edu/institutes-and-centers/center-for-infectious-disease-dynamics/covid-19-faq-askcidd) and I think it's awesome. They also have [video explainers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDP0HPr7KCwJcfkEdE0zRT3tU9o3p6mjw) for some of the more popular questions. Just another useful resource to check out! You can also submit questions to them via the email listed on their site.

As always, feel free to reach out via the message box on the [about page](https://dradrian.netlify.app/about/) of this blog or directly if you'd like to discuss questions and/or things you've read, or are curious about where to find resources to learn more.
