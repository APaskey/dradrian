Hello again, friends and fam...after a year break which included a job change, cross-country move, being hit by a tornado, and having a baby, I'm back online to do my best to address your questions and to amplify/interpret info relevant to this pandemic life we're living. Please feel free to text/email/DM me questions, or you can submit questions via the bottom of the [About](https://dradrian.netlify.app/about/) page of this site. May this site continue to help demystify some of the terminology of the infectious disease world and be helpful to you, my friends.
