Today the UK had a press conference and discussed their data on variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 in the UK. The UK is doing an epic job at sequencing and analyzing data; kudos to them. Here’s the take-home: variant B.1.1.7 is more transmissible, without a question. There is also “a realistic possibility that infection with VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death compared to infection with non-VOC viruses.” [Read their report here.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/955239/NERVTAG_paper_on_variant_of_concern__VOC__B.1.1.7.pdf) They also say “absolute risk of death per infection remains low.” So please, don’t panic, but also be aware that because of new variants like B.1.1.7, it’s easier to get infected and also possible that you might get sicker.

While it’s disconcerting that everyone is at a greater risk to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, we can still use preventative measures to protect ourselves and others:

- Wear a sturdy mask when you leave your house. This might look like swapping your neck gaiter out for two masks layered on top of each other when you go to the grocery store. (Hi, Dad <3)
- Avoid indoor gatherings. As much as [90% of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to occur indoors!](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v1.full-text) [Ventilation/being outdoors helps reduce the risk of transmission.](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1442/5910315)
- Continue to use good hand/respiratory hygiene. [This instructional video with dramatic background music is great,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) even if you’ve never washed your hands before. ;-)
- Get vaccinated when you’re eligible ([the vaccine protects against this variant](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html))
