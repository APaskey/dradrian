As a mini-refresher, mRNA from the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines goes into the muscle cells and is protected by lipids. Once it reaches the cytoplasm then the spike protein can be produced and displayed to our immune system to give a great practice run and gain immunity against SARS-CoV-2. We can’t just inject unprotected mRNA into our bodies and expect it to make it into a muscle cell because our bodies have special enzymes wandering about that specifically destroy free-floating RNA, so this is where the lipid protection comes in. The particles include several types of fatty molecules ([here’s one example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315)), and are formulated to match human body chemistry so that they are met neutrally and able to protect the mRNA until it gets into a muscle cell. One reason that specific/special synthetic lipids are needed is to balance the electrical charge of the RNA.

[Here’s an article that tries to break it down but I think it gets pretty technical](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/11/rna-vaccines-and-their-lipids). The photo near the bottom shows how lipids naturally stack up; the fragile mRNA in the vaccine can sit protected inside that lipid bubble!
