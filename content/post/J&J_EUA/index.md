Now that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the US, I’m excited to see our # of people vaccinated per day increase! This is definitely great news in my opinion, because it means that more people who want the vaccine will be able to access it. Here’s the take-home I want you to remember: **this vaccine protected 100% against death from COVID in the trial.** I’ll break this post into 3 sections: 1) What is it?; 2) The outcome of the trial; 3) The logistics of getting this shot

**1) What is it?**

This vaccine is an adenoviral vector vaccine, similar in design to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine [I wrote about earlier.](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/astrazeneca/) In the J&J vaccine, a non-replicating version of a mild cold virus called human adenovirus 26 is used to present the genetic information for the spike protein to your cells. You cells can then produce the spike protein parts and your body will get a practice run in detecting the spike of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to the mRNA vaccines, this vaccine does not include the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus particle and *it is not possible to get COVID from taking the vaccine.* One difference is that the adenoviral vector vaccines are more durable than mRNA vaccines because of the protection from the adenovirus containing the genetic info, and therefore it can be kept at regular fridge temps. This makes the J&J vaccine a portable addition to our end-the-pandemic toolkit! Insofar as side effects, you can expect a sore arm (almost half of folks reported this), and probably a headache/feeling tired (in about ~38% of recipients). Based on the reported data, one could expect the side effects from the J&J vaccine to be less than those from the mRNA vaccine.

For anyone wondering about the “newness” of this particular vaccine design, here’s a little info that might help ([more in the FDA report](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download)): the human adenovirus 26 (Ad6) vector platform has been used in the Ebola vaccine which was approved by the European Medicines Agency last summer and is also used in a handful of vaccines being tested - these have been deemed safe. Almost 200,000 people have already received this vaccine platform across all clinical studies/vaccination programs combined.

**2) The outcome of the trial**

After J&J’s press release, I wrote about the efficacy [in this post](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/jj_vaccine/) and the fact that it provides 100% protection from severe COVID and all variants after 49 days. We just love some good data around here, and you can read all about it in [the FDA’s briefing document.](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) The trials were held in the US, South Africa, and Brazil. More stats from the trial show that it prevented 66% of symptomatic COVID after 2 weeks across all locations, and more impressively that it prevented 85.4% of severe COVID after 4 weeks. Here’s what I think is the most important part: **this vaccine protected 100% against death from COVID in the trial, measured beginning 4 weeks after one dose.** Said another way, nobody died from COVID after they got the J&J vaccine in this trial.

We also get some new stats related to infection from J&J! Remember how I’ve been writing that we need to [make sure we wear masks and avoid getting infected even after being vaccinated](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/keep_wearing_masks/) because there isn’t much data on how likely it is vaccinated folks can asymptomatically spread SARS-CoV-2? During the trial, participants were tested for infection and found an efficacy of 74.2% against infection. This makes me feel optimistic, but also is obviously not 100% so I know if I received this vaccine I’d want to personally keep [layering measures of protection](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/risk_vs_safety/) until my community reaches herd immunity so I don’t infect anyone unintentionally.

**3) The logistics of getting this shot**

You only need **one dose** of this vaccine. Forgetful people, and anyone who hates needles: this is a good option for you! Remember that for this shot your body needs ~4 weeks to build its best immunity, and that you should keep wearing a mask/adhering to local protocol to keep vulnerable members of your community safe. You can also [sign up for v-safe](https://vsafe.cdc.gov) to report your symptoms! More on post-vaccine life [in this post.](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/vsafe/) Remember, it’s a good idea to get vaccinated [even if you’ve already had COVID](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/natural_infection/) because you can have more efficient and longer-lasting immunity following vaccination than via natural infection.

That’s all for now; please keep reaching out with questions!
