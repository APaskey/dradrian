The point of getting a vaccination is to gain immunological memory that will protect you from getting a disease in the future. Both the innate and adaptive immune systems are necessary for vaccination to work. The “department” of your body in charge of immunological memory is called the adaptive immune system. When you get a vaccine, you’re giving the adaptive immune system a chance to memorize potential pathogens before they’re encountered out and about, where you life happens. You can think of the body’s capacity for immunological memory as analogous to our efforts to memorize a phone number or a factoid; how often we see the information or repeat it to ourselves impacts how long it “sticks” in our memories.

It’s not unusual for vaccines to require more than one dose. If you think about your [child’s vaccination schedule,](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) you might remember that that there are as many as 5 doses (DTaP) required for some vaccines. We describe the 1st dose as the **priming dose**, in which the immune system first sees antigens (in the case of currently-approved COVID vaccines, the bits of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2) and *primes* the adaptive immune system by generating low levels of antibodies that can bind to multiple parts of that antigen (called epitopes) if it encounters them in the future. The adaptive immune system, also called acquired immune system, has the unique ability to remember invading pathogens long-term and also to improve its aim, so to speak. After the immune system is primed from the 1st dose, the 2nd dose is delivered at just the right time to increase circulating antibody levels (hopefully for a longer period than from the 1st dose alone) and to produce antibodies that bind even better to the spike protein epitopes (this is called affinity maturation). The physical process of building immunity is slow, which is why vaccines aren’t effective overnight. However, after a few weeks the resulting immune memory can respond quickly to protect you in the future. The approved mRNA vaccines are given 21-28 days apart in the US, and while there is some flexibility with scheduling the 2nd appointment, it’s really important to make sure you follow up to get the 2nd dose!
