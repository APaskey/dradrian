Dr. Wallace has first-hand experience with clinical studies involving vaccines, and I think everyone should check out [his latest article.](https://www.skagitregionalhealth.org/healthquest/blog/2021/01/08/covid-vaccines-our-path-back-to-%27normal%27?fbclid=IwAR0kmVsoAn-ap5tljW5Ke7D9l2ylDxS035FgueZHFwSP4mt0vqWRouqLB7U)

"For people of all age groups, the risk of COVID far outweighs the risks of vaccination. As mature citizens and consumers of health care, we need to step up and take the vaccines offered to us to protect ourselves, our friends, family and society as a whole.
