What I’d really, really like you to know is this:
- A negative PCR or antigen test doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t have COVID
- A positive antibody test following natural infection doesn’t necessarily mean you’re immune to COVID long-term
- When in doubt, stay home

**PCR tests (also called molecular tests, viral RNA tests, nucleic acid tests)**
PCR tests are used to check for nucleic acid from the virus in a person’s nasal swab. This test does not check for prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, and can only tell if the genetic material from the virus is present at the time of the test. It could take 5-14 days for a PCR test to become positive after a person is exposed because the virus takes days to create enough copies of itself to be detected. When I needed to get this test at a drive-through test site in Fort Collins outside my doctor’s office last summer, my insurance covered it. You can probably find something similar in your area if needed. The FDA has now approved a [home testing kit](https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/at-home-test-kits/covid-19-test-home-collection-kit) that you mail to a lab, as well. *Accuracy* for PCR tests is great, but the false negative rate is [estimated to be as high as 20% around day 5 of symptoms](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-1495) so please don’t take a negative test to mean you definitely aren’t infected.

*A positive PCR test* means that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in the nasal swab. More likely than not, this person has COVID and absolutely should isolate from others for 14 days. False positives are extremely rare.

*A negative PCR test* means that nucleic acid was not detected in the nasal swab (if someone was exposed within 5 days of the test, the could still be infected and “incubating,” but the test would not yet be positive). Always interpret a negative test with caution.

**Antigen tests**
[I covered antigen tests like BinaxNOW in another post.](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/ag_tests/) Antigen tests are used to check for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus protein. This test does not check for prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, and can only tell if SARS-CoV-2 virus protein is present in the nasal swab at the time of the test. Similar to a PCR test, it could take 5 days or longer for an antigen test to become positive after a person is exposed and enough virus particles to be detected are produced. Different from a PCR test, antigen tests are more likely to have false negatives. This means that someone might be contagious with COVID and test negative on an antigen test. *Accuracy* reports vary a lot.

*A positive antigen test* means that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles are in the nasal swab. One can have high certainty that this person is contagious and has COVID.

*A negative antigen test* means that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were not detected in the nasal swab. This negative test can’t tell us a whole lot other than that their nose doesn’t have a ton of SARS-CoV-2 in it at the moment — they could still have COVID.

**Antibody tests (also called serologic tests)**
Antibody tests are used to check in blood for past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. These tests have limited value because they cannot tell if you are immune to COVID in the future. It could take 1-3 weeks for an antibody test to be positive after a person is infected and mounts an immune response (develops antibodies). *Accuracy* several weeks after infection is decent and, based on what is known currently, if there is a false result it is more likely to be a false positive. [Here’s what the CDC has to say about antibody testing.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html#anchor_1590264273029)

*A positive test* means that a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or cross-reacting virus in the past. It does *not* mean that a person is currently infected (but they could be).

*A negative test* means that a person either was not infected with SARS-CoV-2 (or cross-reacting virus) in the past or did not mount an immune response if they were.

As I mentioned in my antigen testing [post](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/ag_tests/), I really like the FDA’s communication on testing.
