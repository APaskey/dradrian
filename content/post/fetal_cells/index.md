This topic has the potential to make some of us feel a little edgy, and I considered avoiding the topic entirely. I will do my best to make sure the facts are here and to use accessible language - feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss more. I’d like to start by saying that I don’t think anyone is stupid or selfish for caring about the ethics behind biomedical research and development. Like every field, biomedical research has ongoing ethical conversations surrounding why or how we do things, and where we can improve in the future. That being said, I would encourage everyone concerned about the use of historical cell lines that were derived from aborted fetal cells or animal products to reflect on the best way to express concern and also get us out of the pandemic. Many therapeutics that are used in the United States were developed or discovered using similar tools, and so if this larger issue is now on your radar thanks to detailed press coverage during COVID, then I recommend you focus on the issue of use of historical cell lines in biomedical research rather than avoiding the products of biomedical research. Vaccines have been one of the most effective medical interventions and thankfully they aren’t going away anytime soon. It is necessary to get vaccinated with the currently recommended set of vaccines to protect our children and the immunocompromised in our society.

*Now let’s talk about cell lines*
Cell lines are a tool that scientists use to make vaccines, as well as for numerous other experiments such as studying viruses, gene function, antibody production, drug cytotoxicity and more…they’re really important! A specific cell line is derived from one original ancestor cell. In 2020, we have options to customize our experiments to use cell lines that really suit our experiments, thanks to the combination of cell lines passed down through generations of scientists and ones that were more recently developed. One of my brilliant classmates in graduate school dedicated much time and effort into establishing a new cell line - it wasn’t easy and it is a **big deal**! Things get complicated when you throw access to materials and funding into the mix, but I think you will understand this very basic illustration and that cell lines are an important tool for research and development, and they can’t just be conjured from thin air.
[Several cell lines were derived from fetal tissue back in the 1960 and 70s](https://www.nature.com/news/medical-research-cell-division-1.13273) - the cells in use today are technically propagated from those original cells and are very distant from the original abortions. To take a look specifically at the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, **neither use cell lines derived from fetal cells for the production of their vaccines.** That being said, it’s probable that some of these cell lines were used in experiments during research and development. The use of historical cell lines in biomedical research does not endorse abortion, nor were the original abortions performed for the purpose of gathering cells. To paraphrase NIH Director Francis Collins, it isn’t an endorsement of murder to obtain an organ donation from a person who was murdered. Likewise, the use of the vaccine does not endorse abortion. Given a moral obligation to vaccinate for the safety of others, I urge you not to use this as a reason to forgo vaccination.
