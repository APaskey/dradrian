My short answer is yes, they’re legit, but with the caveat that they are less sensitive. You may have noticed advertisements on the radio for rapid COVID antigen tests available in your community. The American Society for Microbiology published a great breakdown of how antigen tests work, and I encourage you to [check out their article for in-depth info.](https://asm.org/Articles/2020/August/How-the-SARS-CoV-2-EUA-Antigen-Tests-Work)

In short, antigen tests are different from qPCR or antibody tests, as described in the bullets below. I also found a nice video by the FDA and page with an overview of tests, and you can [check that out here.](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-disease-2019-testing-basics#:~:text=Antigen%20tests%20usually%20provide%20results,of%20missing%20an%20active%20infection.) 
- qPCR measures viral RNA, the genetic material that encodes SARS-CoV-2
- Antibody tests measure whether you’ve had an immune response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (at least 1-2 weeks post-infection)
- Antigen tests allow you to check for the presence of viral proteins

Antigen tests like the [Abbott BinaxNOW Ag COVID-19 Card](https://www.fda.gov/media/141567/download) are fast, relatively inexpensive, and have straightforward results that can be read like a pregnancy test. This test requires a shallow nasal swab, and is considered to be very accurate **when the result is positive.** However, a negative test does not necessary mean that the person is not infected with SARS-CoV-2 because the *sensitivity* is not as good as PCR (I’ve seen estimates all over the board for how sensitive in the real world). Given the accessibility and cost of this test, I believe it would be well-used for someone who has experienced ~5 days of symptoms. I would absolutely interpret a negative result from this test with caution. In a world with limitless resources, I imagine that we’d be using these tests before anyone enters a school building, grocery store, or wedding venue to try to make sure that folks who are shedding enough virus to be detected by an antigen test can learn so and make sure they stay home (I’ve also seen good arguments against this idea). So, yes, the Abbott BinaxNOW Ag test is useful and also should be interpreted with caution.
