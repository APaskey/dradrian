There is no evidence that either mRNA vaccines affect fertility. While there are no formal studies on this, let’s look at some examples that should give you peace of mind.

When someone receives the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, their immune system responds to protect against the spike protein, and remembers it should that protein be encountered again in the future (more on that [here](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/adaptive_immunity/) and [here).](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fabout-vaccines%2Fhow-they-work.html) We know that pregnancy is a risk factor for more severe COVID, but an increase in miscarriage rates has not been observed.

Data from the [FDA briefing doc if you're interested:](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download)
- A reproductive toxicity study using rats showed that there were no complications related to reproduction or fetal development after receiving the Moderna vaccine (Pfizer studies found similar results)
- In the Moderna trial, there were 13 pregnancies (6 received the mRNA vaccine, 7 received the placebo). Of the **vaccinated** group, there were **no** adverse pregnancy-related events.

It’s important to note that being pregnant was a reason to be excluded from the Moderna trial on Day 1. That means all 6 who received the mRNA vaccine got pregnant *during the trial* and at least after the first dose. No worries on that front if you’re trying to conceive! If you are pregnant and eligible for vaccination in your state, please reach out to your primary care provider to discuss vaccination, risk and pregnancy to decide what is right for you and your family.

Here is the [FDA’s statement,](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions) which I think sums things up really well: “There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the vaccine could cause infertility in women. In addition, infertility is not known to occur as a result of natural COVID-19 disease, further demonstrating that immune responses to the virus, whether induced by infection or a vaccine, are not a cause of infertility. Reports on social media have falsely asserted that the vaccine could cause infertility in women and the FDA is concerned that this misinformation may cause women to avoid vaccination to prevent COVID-19, which is a potentially serious and life-threatening disease. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary and are unpredictable; many people have no symptoms or only mild disease, while some have severe respiratory disease including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a mRNA vaccine. It contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. After a person is vaccinated, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, and triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Contrary to false reports on social media, this protein is not the same as any involved in formation of the placenta.”

A few closing key points in case you’re on the fence:

- Pregnancy puts you at higher risk for severe COVID 
- mRNA vaccines **do not contain live virus**
- There is no data that shows that COVID vaccines or COVID infection cause infertility
