On March 29, 2022, [FDA authorized booster shots for anyone over the age of 50 or who is immunocompromised](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-second-booster-dose-two-covid-19-vaccines-older-and) if it’s been 4 months (or longer) since their last booster. This means if you got your booster as soon as it was recommended in fall 2021 and you’re over 50, it’s time to schedule another booster. The booster can be Pfizer or Moderna.

Follow this [handy table](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html#:~:text=After%20this%20time%20period%2C,considered%20up%20to%20date.) on the CDC’s website for guidance on which type of booster is recommended based on your COVID-19 vaccine history.

**What was the evidence behind this recommendation?**

Real-world evidence was used to justify this recommendation. Healthcare workers in Israel had a better immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (including delta and omicron) after a booster shot given 4 months after the initial booster. There were no new safety concerns after hundreds of thousands of older folks in Israel received a second booster (aka 4th mRNA vaccine dose). Separate from these data, the safety of a Moderna booster was studied by boosting individuals who were previously fully vaccinated with Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine.

**What about everybody else?**

The protective benefit was convincing enough for FDA to recommend another booster for higher-risk individuals, but there isn’t the same urgency for lower-risk individuals. If you chose not to get the initial booster, perhaps consider taking one. The [CDC reported](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0328-covid-19-boosters.html) that “During the recent Omicron surge, those who were boosted were 21 times less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those who were unvaccinated, and 7 times less likely to be hospitalized.”
