Yay you, you got vaccinated!

1. [Sign up for v-safe](https://vsafe.cdc.gov) to report your symptoms. CDC will text you every day to ask you how you’re feeling and give you the chance to record any symptoms. For example, the day after my first dose of the Moderna mRNA vaccine, I reported that I felt good and had arm soreness. If you report concerning symptoms, someone from CDC will call to check on you and help you figure out what to do next. [Get more info on v-safe here.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html)

2. [Keep wearing a mask](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/keep_wearing_masks/) and maintain 6 ft+ distance from those not in your household until your community has reached herd immunity. Even though the vaccine will probably protect you from experiencing COVID symptoms, you could still possibly become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and pass it on to someone who is not immune. I’d hate to give someone COVID before they’ve gotten the chance to get vaccinated!

3. Remember that [the body takes time to build immunity,](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/two_doses/) and you won’t be immune until ~2 weeks after your last dose. If you receive an mRNA vaccine, that means 2 weeks after the [2nd dose.](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/adaptive_immunity/)
