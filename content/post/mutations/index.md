Right now there is a lot of media coverage of a new variant that was detected in the UK — notice that I’m calling it a variant. It’s important to remember that there really is just one “strain” that causes COVID-19, and that’s called SARS-CoV-2. We know that RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 mutate at a well-studied rate, and in particular that viruses in the family *Coronaviridae* have special features that impact how quickly or where in its genome it does (or doesn’t) mutate. The virus will continue to mutate over time, and we are able to capture that information in detail thanks to surveillance work that includes high throughput sequencing of samples from folks who were infected. If anybody has curious questions about sequencing please reach out (that’s my jam).

We know that SARS-CoV-2 mutates over time, and we are able to track those changes globally and ask relevant questions about what we find. The crucial step that follows when a new variant is detected is to ask, “Is this biologically relevant?” This is the question that we will ask ourselves repeatedly, even after the pandemic is over. Let me summarize at a simple level what is known:

1. There’s actually a list of mutations that the UK’s scientists are following, and you can [read about why in this recent report.](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Report-1_COG-UK_20-December-2020_SARS-CoV-2-Mutations_final.pdf)


2. The lineage the media is focused on is called B.1.1.7, and the reason it’s being tracked by scientists is that they’ve detected an uptick in cases that belong to this lineage and contain an unusual number of mutations in the part of the virus that help it get into human cells (spike). I’m not going to get too technical about the spike protein here, but please reach out to discuss if you’re curious or came across any confusing info!


3. We don’t have a way to know yet if the uptick in cases is because of human behavior or because the virus has become more transmissible. If everyone made sure to wear masks, wash their hands/use hand sanitizer, stay 6 ft. apart/stayed home when possible, then it might be easier to tease out if this trend happened by luck. 


4. The biggest concern I’ve heard from friends and family with regard to this sort of news is related to whether the vaccine will still work or not. This is such a relevant question! Lots of work is dedicated to tracking mutations with this issue in mind. Here’s the upshot: when our body gets the “practice run” from a vaccine and learns to protect us from COVID, it will remember the spike protein from every angle. Therefore, even if bits and pieces of the spike look a little different, our bodies will still recognize the parts of the spike that look the same. In that case, the vaccine will still work! Given what we know about the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, it would take years of mutations for the vaccines to stop working for us - and thankfully adjustments can be made in anticipation of that. 

I think it’s really important to remember that the UK is doing a great job in sequencing so many samples and keeping an eye out for any potential variants that could evade vaccines in the future. A similar set of mutations is also being tracked in South Africa. My opinion is that it would be ideal if the same level of surveillance could be applied to humans and animals on every continent to provide a broader picture of what changes are occurring during this global pandemic.

If you’re looking for an expert in the UK to follow on this topic, I recommend the brilliant Dr. Muge Cevik [(@mugecevik).](https://twitter.com/mugecevik?s=20)
