First, make sure you talk to your doctor about every health-related decisions you make, from diet and exercise changes to getting vaccinated, especially if you have an underlying condition and/or take medication. 

Last week, some European countries briefly paused their vaccine campaigns using the AstraZeneca vaccine because there was some thought that there might be a risk for blood clots in a specific subgroup. The data indicates there aren’t more blood clots in people who received that vaccine than the general population, which would mean any blood clots in people who did (or did not) receive the vaccine are unrelated to the vaccine. When concerns like this arise, scientists and reviewers look closely to make sure they aren’t missing something in the data. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not approved in the US yet and there’s no associated risk with the Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Vaccination has resumed in Europe after the brief pause.
