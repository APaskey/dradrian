During the course of the pandemic, local guidance for restaurants and gatherings has changed quite a bit in response to reported cases. I found myself looking into the details of air ventilation vs. SARS-CoV-2 transmission when trying to make decisions with regard to whether I wanted to accept the risk of dining in a restaurant, or what risk might look like outdoors in a tent/enclosure versus outdoors in open air. Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s the best decision for everyone (or, as 1 Corinthians 5 says, "'Everything is permissible for me' - but not everything is beneficial." and I think in some ways this applies here) — what I’m hoping to do through this post is give you information so that you can have adequate information to make decisions for yourself. I’ll walk through three scenarios of risk: 1) indoors, 2) outdoors in open air, and 3) outdoors in an enclosure/tent.

Remember that there are multiple factors at play when it comes to risk, like how much space is between individuals, how long they are in contact, mask-wearing compliance (and mask quality/fit), household crowding, age, immune status, and environment (more on that [here](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1442/5910315)). In this post, I’m isolating the environment part.

**1) Indoors**

The highest transmission risk is in poorly-ventilated indoor spaces where there is “increased likelihood of aerosol emission” (that means loud singing, talking, or aerobic activity), and the risk is the greatest when not everybody opts to wear masks (e.g., indoor dining, gyms, choirs, churches, family gatherings).[Report here.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/933225/S0824_SARS-CoV-2_Transmission_routes_and_environments.pdf) It makes sense: since we know that COVID is spread when we cough, spittle, or produce aerosols by talking loudly, for example, those are definitely the scenarios where I’m personally most likely to be doing those things around other people. The CDC found that folks in their study with COVID symptoms were more likely to have reported dining in a restaurant or bar/coffee shop as compared to control participants ([link to MMWR report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm)).

One way to lower the risk of transmission if indoors is to improve air ventilation by opening windows and doors! The Public Health England Transmission Group complied the table below [(full report here)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-factors-contributing-to-risk-of-sars-cov2-transmission-in-various-settings-26-november-2020) and I think it gives some great cues to what makes a setting more or less risky.

**2) Outdoors in open air**

The table above essentially posts indoors and outdoors as opposites on the risk scale. This is not to say that there is *zero* risk to interacting outdoors, as risk goes up as proximity + time increase, but definitely the “safest bet” if that’s what we’re going for. While viruses that make it through an infected person’s mask to potentially infect someone will hang around longer in an indoor space, the air movement outdoors diminishes that risk enormously. In fact, contact tracing studies have found that transmission risk is 20x higher indoors as compared to outdoor environments (wow! [Clinical Infectious Diseases article](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1442/5910315)).

It’s cold in Colorado, y’all, and those restaurant tents seem to be everywhere…here’s what I found on the tent situation: 

**3) Outdoors in an enclosure/tent**

When it comes to outdoor dining, I’ve seen lots of creative combos from restaurants. The level of environmental risk (remember spacing, mask compliance, time spent together, etc. are all other factors that matter, too) directly correlates to the **air ventilation.** How many sides are there to the enclosure? Is there a roof? The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment created a clear set of [guidelines for dining enclosures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Z0KtLhe5tBRgV835NP4qTijpQCNpOMv/view) that makes a lot of sense to me; tents are considered to have good ventilation if they meet the following criteria:

- Two non-joining sides open so air can flow through it (think like a tunnel)
- Two joined sides but no roof
- Roof/canopy and no walls
- “Pod” structure that is ventilated between uses (i.e., just your household would eat in the tent and it would get aired out before the next party used it)

This means the following is categorized as not having good ventilation and is comparable to dining indoors:

- Three or four walls with a roof
- Two adjacent walls with a roof

It’s all about letting air flow. Takeout is always a fair call when your restaurant of choice isn’t offering a dining option that makes sense for you.

I’ll leave you with this thought: [“there’s a big difference between taking steps that *appear* to reduce COVID risk and those that *actually* reduce COVID risk.”](https://twitter.com/DLeonhardt/status/1360228687073972228) I hope you now have just a little bit more info to make sure your energy is appropriately directed (let’s face it; we’re all tired these days). Be smart and stay curious!
