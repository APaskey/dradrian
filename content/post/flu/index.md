I came across this article on a site I follow (Kinsa, a company that aggregates data on illness, particularly in kiddos). I think it's worth sharing. If you're curious about flu's offseason comeback, check [this article](https://healthweather.us/analysis/is-the-flu-making-a-late-season-comeback?utm_campaign=Health%20Alerts&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=210361718&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Z6G47N93e8a0hQM2Kd86UCeWzW_cyFsjJ9ZnJFTPp0soAjPrJu6M-evhwb2U6s3dVNjnfSWNqIc9HTQVFexAVz_gg-w&utm_content=210362202&utm_source=hs_email) out! If you're COVID-negative this spring but have flu-like symptoms, your doc may have you checked for flu even though it's not typical "flu season."


A different topic, but also touches on flu and other infections...I recently saw this blog (written by the CEO of Kinsa) that might interest you: [How kindness can play a role in public health](https://inder-singh.medium.com/killing-it-with-kindness-how-respect-can-change-the-covid-game-d63342137c1d).
