Let me start with this: public perception about wearing a mask (fun fact, the fancy word for things like this that we do protect ourselves is “nonpharmaceutical intervention”) has changed wildly over the course of the pandemic. I’m not here to tell you what my preferences are, or to applaud/shame you for yours. What I would like to share is information related to COVID risk that may lead some individuals to choose to wear or not to wear masks, in case it may be helpful.

**Let’s look at reasons why a person’s assessment of COVID risk may lead them to choose not to mask at Aldi (aka anywhere in public) right now:**

-They may have recently recovered from COVID. Very recently-infected individuals are unlikely to get reinfected within a 90-day window (could be shorter). Someone who has had COVID within this window may choose not to mask because they assume (probably correctly) that they are not at risk of infecting/becoming infected with the currently-circulating predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2. Note that having COVID does not provide long-term protection from subsequent reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.

- Case rates in their community may be very low. This is tricky because “low risk” could be defined different ways. If you’re interested on info and data governments/businesses use to define levels for risk of infection (or what I look for when making decisions for myself), please reach out.


**Now, let’s look at reasons why we might want to mask in public right now:**

*Scenario 1: they’re at risk*
- *Immunocompromised* people are in general at risk for getting sick more often, or when they do get sick it’s likely they’ll be sicker than most people. I can’t tell just by looking at someone if they are immunocompromised.
- *Unvaccinated* people are at risk for bad outcomes with COVID, and masking cuts down the chances of becoming infected. There are a handful of reasons a person may be unvaccinated, including certain health conditions/cancer. If this is you, I suggest choosing an N95 or KN94 mask over a cloth mask.

*Scenario 2: their people are at risk*
- If someone lives with, works with, or otherwise cares for someone who is at greater risk of having a terrible time with COVID (think elderly, immunocompromised, or unvaccinated adults), they may choose to mask to avoid bringing disease to those in their work/personal circles. 
-If someone cares for children under 5 years old, they may choose to mask to reduce the risk of spreading COIVD to them. Unfortunately, children under 5 are still without any COVID vaccine options.

…or maybe they don’t have a reason one way or the other and *you* getting curious and asking the question (kindly! not shaming!) could help them think it through.

As you’ve probably noticed, the rates of infection and other factors influencing our perception of risk have fluctuated during various seasons of the pandemic and this may cause a person to reassess the above choices. This leads into the question of whether we’ll be masking in certain places in public forever, which is ultimately a question that in my opinion will be answered by social determinants and not infectious diseases.
