There’s been confusing messaging coming from the Oxford-AstraZeneca trials, including some allergic reactions that caused the trial to pause earlier this year and even dosing mixups that slowed them down. I understand that this can seem scary or like this vaccine doesn’t deserve your trust, but I think with more information you might be more open to this vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is an **adenoviral vector**-based vaccine, meaning that the designers used a non-replicating version of another virus (called adenovirus; some types of it can cause respiratory disease or diarrhea in humans but this one doesn’t make people sick) and use it to present the genetic information for the spike protein to your cells. Your cells can then produce the spike protein parts and your body will get a practice run in detecting the spike of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to the mRNA vaccines, this vaccine does not include the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus particle and it is not possible to get COVID from taking the vaccine. 

This approach has been studied for years, and has been previously applied to vaccines against Ebola and Zika. One clear benefit to using an adenovirus, which is a DNA virus, instead of RNA to make up a vaccine is that DNA is not so fragile as RNA. This, combined with some physical protection provided by an adenovirus, means that the vaccine can be stored at regular fridge temperatures and requires less logistical legwork to be distributed around the world. This vaccine is also cheaper, ringing in around $4 per shot. Not bad! 

While I can write some arguments about why using vectors (technical way to say it: heterologous viral expression system) is not the way we should design vaccines in the future, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is ready in the here-and-now. The moment it’s approved in the USA I predict our wait time to vaccination will decrease significantly, and I will gladly take an Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine when it becomes available. I speculate that this vaccination course may ultimately include an initial vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine and a booster with another type of vaccine (maybe [Novavax](https://dradrian.netlify.app/post/novavax/)?) in the future. We can expect that it will be widely available once approved, as billions of doses will be distributed in 2021.

Here’s the take-home:
1. The adenovirus vector can’t reproduce in your body
2. We don’t know yet when it will be approved in the US
3. The technology used to design this vaccine has been studied for other viruses, and it’s not new
4. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is well-suited for distribution anywhere there’s a refrigerator 
5. It’s inexpensive!
