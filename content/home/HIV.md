Ok, nobody actually asked me this one yet, but I anticipated there will be questions over the next week or so, and I’ll draft my first thoughts here now: One vaccine that did not make it through clinical trials in Australia because it cause the immune system to respond to both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. There are two very important parts here: 1) the vaccine probably would have protected people from COVID! and 2) the vaccine caused humans to make antibodies against HIV. First, let’s talk about an important distinction in point 2), which is that having antibodies against HIV in this case is NOT because they were infected with HIV. 

The reason people were producing antibodies against HIV is because a part of the vaccine resembled a small part of the HIV virus particle. There was no “infection” or disease, just a surprising consequence because the immune system is just *that* good at remembering what we show it on practice runs through vaccines. This is why we do clinical trials and rigorous reviews, and this is why you won’t be receiving that vaccine candidate. Please reach out if I can explain more or if you have other questions and I’ll keep revising this draft.
