There is understandably hesitancy as we all seek to do what is best for ourselves and our families. There are many reasons that the mRNA vaccines are available first, and some are more complicated than others. As you read my opinion here, please remember that while I’m in the field I’m not a full-time vaccinologist and every vaccine will have finer details and its own story of development. 

First, the technology for mRNA vaccines isn’t new. In fact, it’s been in development for years(1). The combination of new funding and some serendipity (2) helped get mRNA vaccines out the door and to the public way faster than would have happened under usual development— we all know these are unusual times! There is another reason mRNA vaccines could be developed so quickly: virologists did the right thing by sharing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to all scientists as soon as they could (3). Vaccines that are more similar to ones you may have received in the past are indeed under development, but will take longer to produce. The reason mRNA vaccines are a smart choice for SARS-CoV-2 is that they can be developed for emerging pathogens quickly and, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, they cause a targeted response by the immune system to stop the virus from entering cells. Some other types of vaccines don’t require as much knowledge about the virus, but now that we have all this new information thanks to new technology and global sharing of data we are able to harness it to our benefit!

2. Serendipity: thanks to researchers who have studied OG SARS-CoV since it emerged in the early 2000’s, we already knew a lot about coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2. This includes information about the primary mechanism of entry, aka the way the virus gets into human cells. Given that handy info, vaccine developers got a head start. If we had never studied coronaviruses before SARS-CoV-2 emerged, scientists would not have definitively known to focus on some of the buzz words you’ve been hearing about, like ‘receptor binding domain’ and ‘spike protein.’ Thanks to ~70 years of coronavirus research, scientists now stand on the shoulders of those who have paved the path before them.

3. People who did the right thing: Zheng-Li Shi and her team in Wuhan sequenced and isolated SARS-CoV-2 in the very beginning of January. This was amazing news because it meant scientists could understand what was causing the outbreak in Wuhan. The great thing that they did next was share the sequence with scientists around the world; without this sequence, there would be absolutely no way for mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to begin development. I’d also like to add that the team in Wuhan shared their research informally so others could benefit from it ASAP. Usually scientists don’t share their whole research reports until it’s accepted by a formal, fancy publisher and I think it’s fantastic that something new to the field (it’s called “preprints”) has been embraced for a time such as this.

As I mentioned, there are a lot of different types of vaccines that can be made. It’s likely that there will be other types of vaccines available, which is super because we need a lot of doses around the world!
